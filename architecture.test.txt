Imagine a person is using a typical web calendar application using these 4 technologies; MySql, Angular, Node, GraphQl.

Now imagine the person fills in a new event in the calendar app and presses save to create the event.

List the order in which those 4 technologies will be engaged at the moment the user clicks save.

1. GraphQ1  
2. Angular
3. Node
4. MySQL

Feel free to write any additional thoughts or caveats here:

GraphQ1 is the API, angular is the front end language, node serves as the back end language and MySQL is the database so the engagement of the technologies would go from highest 
to deepest which is how I came to the order I did.
